# grely

* update rspec matchers

* relative mode
* choose absolute pitch of the choral key or modern key to set the melody in
* handle accidentals and key

* produce lilypond gregorian notation instead of modern (will be quite hard to do - has to correctly determine neumes)

* the PEG parser is too restrictive for real-world use;
explore the solution of gabc-tk

* test gem build and functionality of installed executables

# lygre

* convert simple lilypond scores (like in the In adiutorium project) to gabc

# gremux

* convert to musixtex (both modern and quadratic notation)
